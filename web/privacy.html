					<p><b>Web Sites</b><br>
					<br>
					When you visit any of our websites we may collect certain information about your usage preferences and history. Such information will be stored in a cookie on your computer's hard drive by your web browser. Cookies are intended to assist and improve your use of our web sites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but usually you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you may not be able to use all the features of our websites.<br>
					<br>
					Every time you connect to our web sites we store web server logs which show your IP address (the unique number which your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet); what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not, and which browser you used to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical and personalisation purposes only. This helps us understand which areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells us how many hits and page requests we get.<br>
					<br>
					Currently we use the following security measures to protect your information when you use our online transaction services:<br>
					<br>
					</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Advanced encryption software using 128 bit encryption built into browsers to establish a Secure Socket Layer (SSL).<br>
					</li>
					<li>You can only use the service if you are registered as a user thereof and chosen an access account number and your own personal identification number (PIN).<br>
					</li>
					<li>You only have three opportunities to enter your PIN correctly. After the third unsuccessful attempt, you will be denied access to the service. To reset your PIN, contact your branch.<br>
					</li>
					<li>If you log on and do not use the service for ten minutes, you will be logged out automatically. To access your accounts again, you will need to log on again.<br>
					</li>
					</ol>
					<p><br>
					<b>Your rights regarding your information</b><br>
